> There was a dream and one day I could see it  
> Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody free it  
> And there was a kid with a head full of doubt  
> So I’ll scream til I die and the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
>
> There’s a darkness upon me that’s flooded in light  
> And I’m frightened by those that don’t see it
