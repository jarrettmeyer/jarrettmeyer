Today, I needed to generate a fake data set, and I wanted to give R a shot for generating the set. The good news is that everything is pretty simple. You just need to know how to do everything in the correct order. The following code will do exactly this task.

{% gist jarrettmeyer/27fc299099376886d5b650c018d96c74 r_insert_postgresql.R %}

I hope this helps. Happy coding!
