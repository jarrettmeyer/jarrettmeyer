I found this prayer while reading to Harold S. Kushner's [When Bad Things Happen to Good People](https://smile.amazon.com/When-Things-Happen-Good-People/dp/1400034728/) and thought it was lovely. I hope you like it, too.

> We cannot merely pray to You, O God, to end war,  
> For we know that You have made the world in a way  
> That man must find his own path to peace  
> Within himself and with his neighbor.
>
> We cannot merely pray to You, O God, to end starvation,  
> For you have already given us the resources  
> With which to feed the entire world  
> If we would only use them wisely.
>
> We cannot merely pray to You, O God, to root out prejudice,  
> For You have already given us eyes  
> With which to see the good in all men  
> If we would only use them rightly.
>
> We cannot merely pray to You, O God, to end despair,  
> For You have already given us the power  
> To clear away slums and to give hope  
> If we would only use our power justly.
>
> We cannot merely pray to You, O God, to end disease,  
> For you have already given us great minds with which  
> To search out cures and healing  
> If we would only use them constructively.
>
> Therefore we pray to You instead, O God,  
> For strength, determination, and willpower,  
> To do, instead of just to pray,  
> To become, instead of merely to wish.
>
> For Your sake and for ours, speedily and soon,  
> That our land and world may be safe,  
> And that our lives may be blessed.
>
> May the words that we pray,  
> and the deeds that we do  
> be acceptable before You, O Lord,  
> Our Rock and Our Redeemer.

&mdash; Rabbi Jack Riemer
