If you're having trouble understanding [D3's merge command](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#joining-data), you are certainly not alone. There are hundreds of very similar [questions on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=d3+merge). It does take some time to understand D3's data binding, and the best way to learn it is to play with it.

<svg id="canvas"></svg>

New elements are added in <span style="color: #296d2a;">green</span>. Existing elements are colored <span style="color: #e08a3a;">orange</span>.

```js
const canvas = d3.select("#canvas");

function update(data) {

    // Select all existing circles. The first time this runs, there will not be
    // anything to select, but that's not a problem.
    let circles = canvas.selectAll("circle")
                        .data(data);

    // Set the class to "update" for all existing circles.
    circles.attr("class", "update");

    // The enter() command will add all new circles with the class "enter". The
    // merge() command will transition any existing circles.
    circles.enter()
           .append("circle")
           .attr("class", "enter")
           .attr("cx", d => xPos(d.index, data.length))
           .attr("cy", height / 2.0)
           .attr("r", d => d.radius)
           .merge(circles)
           .transition()
           .attr("cx", d => xPos(d.index, data.length))
           .attr("r", d => d.radius);

    // Remove any circles that need to be removed.
    circles.exit().remove();
}
```

The complete code for this blog entry is [available in Github](https://github.com/jarrettmeyer/jarrettmeyer.github.io/blob/master/assets/js/merge1.js).

Hopefully this helps you to decipher `enter`, `merge`, and `exit`. Play with it. Build something small and learn how it all works before you try to do this with a really complicated visualization.
