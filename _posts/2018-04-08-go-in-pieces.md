## Benediction

> The task is ended go in pieces.
>
> Our concluding faith is being rear-ended,
> certainty’s being amended
> and something’s getting mended
> that we didn’t know was torn
>
> We’re unravelling
> and are traveling
> to a place of new-formed patterns,
> with delusion as a fusion
> of loss and hope and pain and beauty.
>
> So, the task is ended go in pieces
> to see and feel your world.

By Padraig O Tuama, from *The God Delusion*, 2007.
