            <p>
              All the elders of Israel assembled and came to Samuel at Ramah, and they said to him, 
              "You have grown old, and your sons have not followed your ways. Therefore appoint a 
              king for us, to govern us like all other nations." Samuel was displeased that they said 
              "Give us a king to govern us."
            </p>
