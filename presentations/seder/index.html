                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>If you are invited to a Jewish Passover, you should definitely go. They are always fun and always delicious.</p>
                    <p>The "Christian" Passover meal is offensive, even if you don't intend for it to be. It appropriates Jewish culture, and claims it as your own.</p>
                    <p>Jews have no teaching for the need of salvation. There is no teaching of original sin, nor do we learn that we are defined by our sin. We are taught that our good deeds, individual morality, and relationship with the divine is enough.</p>
