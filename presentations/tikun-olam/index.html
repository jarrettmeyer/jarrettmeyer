            <p>
              If you see what needs to be repaired and you know how to repair it, then you have found 
              a piece of the world that God has left for you to complete. But if you only see what it 
              wrong and what is ugly in the world, then it is you yourself that needs repair.

            <li class="fragment" style="color: blueviolet;">Jews do not share the same ideas of heaven and salvation of other religions</li>
            <li class="fragment" style="color: aqua;">Jews have been banned from seeking converts in most countries for most of history</li>
