    * Opening day.
    * **Exodus 19: You shall be a kingdom of priests, a holy nation.**
    * What does it mean to be a priest? How do you create something new that has never been done before? What kind of negative reception can you expect?

2. 25-Aug-2019
    * **Joshua 5: Are you one of us or one of our enemies?**
    * Are there really only two sides to every argument? When have you been presented with options, and none of them seem like the correct answer? How does polarity hurt our discourse?

3. 08-Sep-2019
    * **I Samuel 17: David and Goliath**
    * How have you dealt with something that you knew 100% to be true, only to learn that you are wrong? How do you challenge preconceived ideas?

    * Food collection for Greenbriar.

6. 13-Oct-2019
    * **Genesis 1: And let us make man in our own image.**
    * What does it mean to be the image of G-d? If G-d looks like us, does that also mean the bad stuff, too? What about genetic anomalies and disfigurement? What about acne and cracking voices and unexpected periods and a lack of coordination because of a changing body? What else could the author mean by "image of God"?
