# 7th Grade Religious Education

**Exploration, not Expectation**

The lesson on [Digging for Demons](/presentations/digging-for-demons/) was, by far, my most successful lesson in the 2019 - 2020 school year. The beauty of this lesson, and the learning for me, is that I had absolutely no goal beyond, "Here's some cool stuff." It was a lesson of **exploration without any expectation**.

## Lesson Ideas

### Who Are You, and What Are You Doing?

More than anything, I want students to start to get a feel of who they are. As a pre-teen or adolescent, they are struggling with figuring out where they fit into this great big world. They are constantly receiving multiple inputs, from within and without.

Key ideas:

-   How many identities do you have?
-   What do you like about yourself?
-   What do you dislike about yourself?

### The Lie Revealed in Shabbat

When the Jews fled Egypt, they had a radical redefinition of who they were. They

Key ideas:

-   You are not defined by your production. You are not the number of bricks you build in a day. You are not how many dollars you earn. You are not your grade on that last assignment.
-   You are only useful if you can make lots of bricks. Production and identity are woven together.
-   Transformation from "human doing" to "human being".
-   40 years in the dessert? Google Maps says walking from Cairo to Jerusalem takes 9 days. There's a difference between getting the slaves out of Egypt and getting Egypt out of the slaves.
-   We are still trapped by this thought: our worth is bound to how many bricks we produce. We still haven't managed to let the slavery go.
-   The beast of production is never satisfied. No matter what you do, it is never enough. If I just get a little more done, then I will be happy. But that is never true.
-   Take a day week and do no production. This doesn't mean the joy of production. There's a difference between painting a house and painting a picture. One is work; the other is something you love.
-   But the secret about Shabbat: you are not your production the other 6 days of the week, either.
-   On Shabbat, the work is done, even if it isn't.

### The Bad Side of Good and the Good Side of Bad

Key ideas:

-   Should we always be peaceful and content?
-   Is there a role for anger?

### Digging for Demons

### Who Is This God Anyway?

Key ideas:

-   Why does God have so many names?
-   How has the idea of God changed from the beginning of Torah to today?
-   Is there an "official" Jewish view on God? (LOL, no.)

### Gratitude, Yoga, Meditation, and Spirituality

### Sitting on the Sidelines

> ...I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season."

People do not respond to our black brothers and sisters being shot. But close a Target because of civil unrest? No, that is a crime!

When you've been beaten, hung, and shot, you do not heal by stopping the beating, hanging, and shooting. You need care. You need the bullets to be removed and bones to be reset. You need time for rest and recovery. You need physical therapy. You definitely need psychological therapy to deal with the PTSD and trauma. Violence does not heal passively by stopping the violence. Healing violence requires positive action.

### Stress As an Amplifier

### Make No Idols
