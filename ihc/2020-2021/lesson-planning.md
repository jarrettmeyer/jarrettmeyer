# 7th Grade Religious Education

**Exploration, not Expectation**

The lesson on [Digging for Demons](/presentations/digging-for-demons/) was, by far, my most successful lesson in the 2019 - 2020 school year. The beauty of this lesson, and the learning for me, is that I had absolutely no goal beyond, "Here's some cool stuff." It was a lesson of **exploration without any expectation**.

## Lesson Ideas

### Who Are You, and What Are You Doing?

More than anything, I want students to start to get a feel of who they are. As a pre-teen or adolescent, they are struggling with figuring out where they fit into this great big world. They are constantly receiving multiple inputs, from within and without.

### The Bad Side of Good and the Good Side of Bad

### Digging for Demons

### Who Is This God Anyway?

### Gratitude, Yoga, Meditation, and Spirituality

### Sitting on the Sidelines

### Stress As an Amplifier

### Make No Idols
