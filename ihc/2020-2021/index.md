# 7th Grade Religious Education

**Exploration, not Expectation**

The lesson on [Digging for Demons](/presentations/digging-for-demons/) was, by far, my most successful lesson in the 2019 - 2020 school year. The beauty of this lesson, and the learning for me, is that I had absolutely no goal beyond, "Here's some cool stuff." It was a lesson of **exploration without any expectation.
