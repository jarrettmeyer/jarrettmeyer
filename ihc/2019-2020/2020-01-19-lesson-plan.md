Rules of Kashrut

1. Any animal that has a cloven hoof and chews its cud is kosher.
   a. Includes cows, sheep, goats, deer, and bison.
   b. Excludes dogs, cats, horses, camels, and rabbits.
2. Any fish that has fins and removeable scales is kosher.
   a. Includes tuna, bass, pike, salmon, walleye, perch, and herring.
   b. Excludes catfish, eel, swordfish, and sharks. Excludes all shellfish, squid, and octopi.
3. Birds of prey and scavengers are forbidden.
   a. Includes chicken, geese, ducks, and turkeys.
   b. Excludes eagles, hawks, falcons, owls, and vultures.
   c. The eggs of kosher birds are kosher.
4. All fruits and vegetables are kosher.
5. Wine is only considered kosher if it is made by Jews. This is because wine was often used as a sacrifice by many religions, and Jews were not allowed to drink wine that could have possibly been made for another god.
6. All reptiles, amphibians, worms, and insects are **not** kosher.
7. Kosher food can become unkosher if certain things happen to it.
   a. Meat and dairy cannot be mixed.
   b. The animal must be slaughtered by a trained Jewish butcher in accordance with Jewish law.
   c. All the blood must be drained from the animal.
   d. The fat surrounding the liver, pancreas, and intestines is not kosher. If the meat is ground and includes this organ fat, the meat is no longer kosher.

21% of Jews report to keeping kosher in the home. Of these, most are vegetarian or pescatarian.
