Hello, Parents!

This week we discussed the following topics:

* We talked about atonement for Yom Kippur. According to most students, they had nothing to atone for. Oh, to relive those days!
* We watched a video about Jerusalem and its intersections of faith. [Jerusalem, 2015.](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0146T50XM/)
* We talked about the Second Temple and sacrificial Judaism. You may want to stress to your children that Jews did not practice human sacrifice in the Temple.
* The topics of murder and rape did come up while talking about sacrificial punishment. I think it is the way with children of this age to believe that all sins are the worst possible sins, and not the myriad minor transgressions we commit daily (e.g. lying, gossip, or generally being unkind to ourselves and others).
* Finally, we also briefly discussed free will when discussing the various quarters (Jewish, Muslim, Christian) quarters and the roles of de juris vs. de facto segregation in the formation of those quarters. This is a topic I would like to explore more this year, and how coercion alters our perception of what is or is not free will.

Announcements:
* Next week, family promise will be collecting gently used clothing. If you have anything to share, please bring it on Sunday and drop it off at the collection table in the gathering space. 

Lâ€™shalom,
