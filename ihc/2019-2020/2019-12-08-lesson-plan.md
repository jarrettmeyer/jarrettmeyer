### Topics

-   Today is the 3rd of a 3-part lesson plan leading up to Chanukah. Students have put themselves into groups. Each group represents a the tribe of Maccabees, following the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem.

    -   Week 1: They created a new "Constitution". All 3 of the teams wanted to create monarchies, which is fine. But even monarchies have rules about what the Monarch/King/Queen is allowed to do.
    -   Week 2: We discussed what civil rights citizens would have.
    -   **Week 3 (Current week):** Public services. Groups should finalize their plans for their new country, and be ready to present their new countries to the rest of the class when we return from our winter break. Questions they should be able to answer:

        -   What public services will be available? These should include education, healthcare, police, fire, public safety, transportation, etc.
        -   How will taxes be collected? Will taxes be imposed on individuals or corporations?
        -   How will laws be enforced? Will laws include fines, prison, or community service? What are the advantages and disadvantages or each of these?
        -   How will disputes between citizens be resolved? Answers can range from arbitration to a duel to the death.
