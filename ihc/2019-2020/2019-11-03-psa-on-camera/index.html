  <h2>Scene 1</h2>

  <pre class="script">
Narrator: Thousands of years ago, Pharaoh wanted to build an enormous empire.

Pharaoh: I need more workers! More!

Pharaoh's Wife: How do you plan on paying for them?

Pharaoh: I don't! I'm going to use slaves.

Pharaoh's Wife: How will you find so many slaves?

Pharaoh: I have a new app called "Find-A-Slave". Look at this! Thousands of slaves,
    and they're all Israelites!

Pharaoh's Wife: Perfect!
  </pre>
  
  <h2>Scene 2</h2>

  <pre class="script">
Narrator: Many, many years later, the slaves cried out to God. On this day, they 
    at the grocery store.

Slaves: This is the worst! We work all day. We don't get paid. We never get a day
    off. Somehow, even with nothing we still have to buy our own food.

Moses: Those poor Israelites. How do they afford anything.

Erin: Yeah. Pharaoh should really pay them more.

Narrator: All of a sudden, the voice of God comes over the intercom.

Voice of God: Attention shoppers, there is a sale on stale bread. And Moses, you
    will be the one to lead my children out of slavery.

Moses: Say what now?
  </pre>
 
  <h2>Scene 3</h2>

  <pre class="script">
Narrator: Moses, Erin, and Miriam went to Pharaoh's office.

Pharaoh: What do you want? I'm a very busy Pharaoh.

Moses: Let my people go.

Pharaoh: Are you crazy? Get out of here!

Miriam: You are not a nice man.

Pharaoh: Being nice doesn't pay the bills.

Erin: You don't pay any of your bills, anyway.

(Miriam and Erin high five.)

Pharaoh: I'm done with this conversion. Police! Get these people out of my office!
  </pre>

  <h2>Scene 4</h2>

  <pre class="script">

    Plague 2 -- No electricy.

    Plague 3 -- Bugs, snakes, bees, wasps. 

    Plague 4 -- Homelessness &amp; poverty.

    Plague 10 -- No wifi.
  </pre>

  <h2>Scene 5</h2>

  <pre class="script">
Narrator: Moses, Erin, and Miriam went back to Pharaoh's office.

Moses: Can we go now?

Erin: Yeah. Your land is pretty terrible.

Miriam: Do you know how much we're going to have to clean up because of you?

Erin: We just got the wifi back on.

Pharaoh: But, my workers! I paid good money for them.

Moses: Say what now?

Miriam: We are literally slaves. You don't pay us.

Pharaoh: Fine go.

Moses: Oh, and one more thing.

Erin: Yeah. It turns out that a lot of us are really good at being lawyers for 
    some reason.

Miriam: We did some studying, and it is totally illegal for you to not pay your 
    employees.

Moses: So we're arresting you. Police! Put this man in jail!
