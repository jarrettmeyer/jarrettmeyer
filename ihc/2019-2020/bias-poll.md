title: Bias Poll
---

On Sunday, February 2, 2020, the IHC 7th grade students participated in a quick bias poll. Students were instructed to write down the first thing that comes into their heads, without any filtering. We emphasized that thoughts and biases are neither good nor bad; they are what they are. Good or bad is determined by what we do with our biases. Do we challenge them and continue to grow? Or do we let them dictate how we will treat people?

Out of 17 responses, these are the top responses in each group.
