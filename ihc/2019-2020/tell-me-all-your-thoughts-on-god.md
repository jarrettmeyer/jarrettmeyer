The following quotes are provided alphabetically by author.

### Baal Shem Tov

> The ideal of man is to be a revelation himself, clearly to recognize himself as a manifestation of God.


> Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Why? Because every human being has a root in the One, and to reject the minutest particle of the One is to reject it all.


> Whenever feeling downcast, each person should vitally remember, "For my sake, the entire world was created."

### Mel Brooks

> Look, I don't want to wax philosophic, but I will say that if you're alive you've got to flap your arms and legs, you've got to jump around a lot, for life is the very opposite of death, and therefore you must, at very least, think noisy and colorfully, or you're not alive.

### Martin Buber

> Every person born in this world represents something new, something that never existed before, something original and unique.


> When two people relate to each other authentically and humanly, God is the electricity that surges between them.


> Where is the dwelling of God? God dwells wherever man lets him in.

### Albert Einstein

> A human being is a part of the whole called by us, "universe," a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.

> The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom the emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand wrapped in awe, is as good as dead; his eyes are closed. The insight into the mystery of life, coupled though it be with fear, has also given rise to religion. To know what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms-this knowledge, this feeling is at the center of true religiousness.

### Anne Frank

> How wonderful it is that no one need wait a single moment to start to improve the world.

> The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be and that God wishes to see people happy, amidst the simple beauty of nature. As long as this exists, and it certainly always will, I know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be. And I firmly believe that nature brings solace in all troubles.

### Viktor E. Frankl

> One should not search for an abstract meaning of life ... Life can be made meaningful in a threefold way: first, through what we give to life ... second, by what we take from the world ... third, through the stand we take toward a fate we no longer can change.

### Erich Fromm

> This definition of "religion" does not tell us anything about its specific content. People may worship animals, trees, idols of gold or stone, an invisible god, a saintly person, or a diabolic leader; they may worship their ancestors, their nation their class or party, money or success. Their religion may be conducive to the development of destructiveness or of love, of domination or of solidarity; it may further their power of reason or paralyze it. They may be aware of their system as being a religious one, different from those of the secular realm, or they may think that they have no religion, and interpret their devotion to certain allegedly secular aims, such as power, money, or success, as nothing but their concern for the practical and the expedient. The question is not one of *religion or not*? but of *which kind of religion*? whether it is one that furthers human development, the unfolding of specifically human powers, or one that paralyzes human growth.


> To have faith requires courage, the ability to take a risk, the readiness even to accept pain and disappointment. Whoever insists on safety and security as primary conditions of life cannot have faith; whoever shuts himself off in a system of defense, where distance and possession are his means of security, makes himself a prisoner. To be loved, and to love, need courage, the courage to judge certain values as of ultimate concern – and to take the jump and to stake everything on these values.


### David ben Judah Hehasid

> *Ein Sof* is a place to which forgetting and oblivion pertain. Why? Because concerning all the *sefirot*, one can search out their reality from the depth of supernal wisdom. From there it is possible to understand one thing from another. However, concerning *Ein Sof*, there is no aspect anywhere to search or probe; nothing can be known of it, for it is hidden and concealed in the mystery of absolute nothingness.


*Ein Sof* is a Kabbalistic reference to the unknowable essence of God. The *sefirot* are the 10 emanations or energies of God.


### Abraham Joshua Heschel

> Our goal should be to live life in radical amazement. ....get up in the morning and look at the world in a way that takes nothing for granted. Everything is phenomenal; everything is incredible; never treat life casually. To be spiritual is to be amazed.

> We are closer to God when we are asking questions than when we think we have the answers.

### Mordecai Kaplan

> To believe in God means to accept life on the assumption that it harbors conditions in the outer world and drives in the human spirit which together impel man to transcend himself. To believe in God means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society. In brief, God is the Power in the cosmos that gives human life the direction that enables the human being to reflect the image of God.


### Emmanuel Levinas

> Faith is not a question of the existence or non-existence of God. It is believing that love without reward is valuable.

### Naomi Levy

> In order for you to see a glimpse of the World to Come, it's important to have a vision of the World to Come.

### Abraham Maslow

> The chicken came first - God would look silly sitting on an egg.

> What is the good life? What is the good man? The good woman? What is the good society and what is my relation to it? What are my obligations to society? What is best for my children? What is justice? Truth? Virtue? What is my relation to nature, to death, to aging, to pain, to illness? How can I live a zestful, enjoyable, meaningful life? What is my responsibility to my brothers? Who are my brothers? What shall I be loyal to? What must I be ready to die for?

### Rashi

> Divided as we may be by religion, we are united by charity.


### Jonathan Sacks

> The test of faith is whether I can make space for difference. Can I recognize God's image in someone who is not in my image, who language, faith, ideal, are different from mine? If I cannot, then I have made God in my image instead of allowing him to remake me in his.


### *Sh'mot* (Exodus)

> You shall have no other gods before me.

> Moshe said, “Oh, let me behold Your Presence!” And God answered, “I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim before you the name Hashem, and the grace that I grant and the compassion that I show. But, you cannot see My face, for man may not see Me and live.” And the Lord said, “See, there is a place near Me. Station yourself on the rock and, as My Presence passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock and shield you with My hand until I have passed by. Then I will take My hand away and you will see My back; but My face must not be seen.”


### Menachem Mendel Schneerson

> If you see what needs to be repaired and you know how to repair it, then you have found a piece of the world that God has left for you to complete. But if you only see what it wrong and what is ugly in the world, then it is you yourself that needs repair.


### Baruch Spinoza

> I believe that a triangle, if it could speak, would say that God is eminently triangular, and a circle that the divine nature is eminently circular; and thus would every one ascribe his own attributes to God.

### Elie Wiesel

> I think he is condemned by himself to loneliness. God is One: he was, he is, he will be always One. One is so lonely. Maybe that is why he created human beings &mdash; to feel less lonely.
