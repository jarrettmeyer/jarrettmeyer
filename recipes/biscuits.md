### Prep butter

-   3/4 c butter

Dice butter into tiny pieces and put back in the refrigerator. You can use immediately, but colder is better.


### Mix the dough

-   3 c AP flour
-   3 tbsp sugar
-   1/2 tsp salt
-   4 tsp baking powder
-   1/2 tsp cream of tartar
-   1 egg
-   1 c milk

Preheat over to 450Â°F.

Mix all ingredients above in a large mixing bowl. Use a pastry cutter to cut in the butter. Mix well until butter is pea sized or slightly smaller.

On a floured surface, knead (12 - 15 folds) and roll out dough to 3/4" thickness.

Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden brown on the top.

### Notes

-   You can use buttermilk. It is thicker than milk, so you should expect to use 1 1/4 c.
