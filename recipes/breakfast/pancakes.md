This recipe was originally found on [AllRecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/).

Makes about 10 4 inch pancakes, so scale as needed.

### Ingredients

-   1 1/2 c AP flour
-   1 tbsp baking powder
-   1/2 tsp salt
-   1 tbsp granulated sugar
-   1 1/4 c milk
-   1 egg
-   3 tbsp melted butter

### Directions

-   Muffin method. 

### Notes

-   The original recipe called for 1 tsp salt. I like salt, and I thought that was a bit much.
-   I like to make this recipe with whole wheat flour. Increase to 1 1/2 c milk, since the whole wheat flour will absorb more liquid.
