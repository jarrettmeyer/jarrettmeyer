title: Cream Cheese Frosting
---

-   16 oz cream cheese
-   1/2 c unsalted butter
-   4 1/2 c confectioner's sugar
-   1 tbsp milk or heavy cream
-   1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
-   pinch of salt

Beat the cream cheese and butter on medium high speed until smooth.

You can add more confectioner's sugar if the frosting is too thin, or more milk if the frosting is too thick. Frosting should be soft, but not runny.

### Notes

-   If you use salted butter, don't add salt
-   Any type of milk or cream will do
