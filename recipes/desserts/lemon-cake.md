This recipe originally appeared on [Sally's Baking Addiction](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/lemon-cake/).

### Ingredients

-   345 g AP flour
-   2 1/2 tsp baking powder
-   1/2 tsp baking soda
-   1/2 tsp salt
-   1 c unsalted butter, room temperature
-   350 g granulated sugar
-   3 large eggs, at room temperature
-   2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
-   1 c buttermilk, at room temperature
-   1 tbsp lemon zest (about 2 lemons)
-   1/3 c (80ml) fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)

### Directions

Preheat oven to 350 Â°F. Grease three 8-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper.

Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.

Combine agreements using creaming method. Mix the butter and salt until light & fluffy. Add liquids. Add solids.

Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for 24 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. Test with a toothpick.

### Notes

-   These cakes are not thick - only about an inch.

-   This cake goes quite well with [raspberry buttercream](/recipes/desserts/raspberry-buttercream).

-   The original recipe called for 9-inch pans and a 21 - 26 minute bake time.
