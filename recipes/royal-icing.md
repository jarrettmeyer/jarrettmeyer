- 480 g confectioner's sugar
- 3 tbsp meringue powder
- 9-10 tbsp water (room temperature)

Mix ingredents with a handheld mixer. 

When you lift the beaters up, the icing that falls back into the bowl should smooth out in about 5-10 seconds. If it is too thick, add a little more water. If it is too thin, add a little more sugar.
