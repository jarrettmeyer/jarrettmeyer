### I Am a Storyteller

Your data tells a story, and I am a storyteller.

I have been an application developer, solutions architect, and business intelligence professional for 14 years. I have worked in the manufacturing, warehousing, accounting, finance, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries. In all industries and applications, the data we collect tells us our history and informs future decision making. We learn about our products, our customers, our employees, and our processes. We adapt, we grow, we improve.

Let's tell your story.
