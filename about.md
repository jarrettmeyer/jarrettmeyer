### I Am a Storyteller

Your data tells a story, and I am a storyteller. 
I produce data visualizations for [Eli Lilly and Company](https://www.lilly.com) as part of the Advanced Analytics and Data Sciences department. 
I have been an application developer, solutions architect, and business intelligence professional since 2004. 
I have been with Eli Lilly since 2018. 
I work with primarily with [D3](https://d3js.org), [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/), [Power Query](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org), and [Spotfire](https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-spotfire).

I write most of my projects in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), package them into a single bundle with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and deploy them with [RedHat Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/).

You can see my work at the following locations.
