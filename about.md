I am a software architect and consultant in Indianapolis, Indiana. My favorite place to work is in the gaps. How you design your systems informs how you structure your software author your code. I specialize in understanding how all of the moving pieces work in harmony to form a complete delivery system. This process begins early in the development cycle, understanding requirements, automating testing, implementing continuous integration, and deploying continuously.

### Respect the data

Everything important is in the data. Our role as developers is to produce, capture, and store high-quality data. The value we provide as software developers is the ability to answer questions. Answering questions depends entirely on the capability to deliver the correct questions to the correct places and capture the correct responses.
